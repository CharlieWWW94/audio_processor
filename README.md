audio_processor

A GUI application that allows users to convert audio files into visual representations of soundwaves using matplotlib. Users can achieve this by providing the file path of a .wav file, or alternatively, I have just added functionality to allow users to record audio live from within the GUI.

Alongside the visual representation of the sound files, users can also alter the pitch (up or down) of their audio file and save a copy - I made this functionality with the help of sounddevices and Librosa.
